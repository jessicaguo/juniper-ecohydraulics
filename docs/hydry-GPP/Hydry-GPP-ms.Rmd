### Summary

-   Some plants exhibit temporally flexible hydraulic regulation, wherein the strictness of hydraulic control (e.g., iso/anisohydry) change in response to environmental conditions, but the implications of flexible hydraulic behavior for plant productivity is unknown.
    The temporal responses of hydraulic behavior and gross primary productivity (GPP) were evaluated for *Juniperus osteosperma*, a semi-arid woodland conifer considered relatively drought resistant.

-   Using a 5-month growing season timeseries of *in situ* plant water potential ($\Psi$) and GPP, the stringency of hydraulic regulation and plant productivity were explored relative to soil water availability and atmospheric demand.

-   *J. osteosperma* experiences weaker hydraulic regulation and higher productivity after monsoon precipitation pulses, when soil moisture water and atmospheric demand are both high.
    The relationship between $\Psi_{PD}$ and $\Psi_{MD}$ ($\sigma$) is strongly correlated with GPP, although only during the monsoon period.
    Interestingly, GPP response more rapidly to moisture inputs than $\sigma$.

-   Flexible hydraulic regulation appears to allow *J. osteosperma* to prolong the period of high carbon uptake following episodic rain events during the growing season.
    While the underlying physiological mechanisms that allow for temporal adjustment need further study, this flexibility can partially explain the success of some drought-tolerant species and suggests why dynamic vegetation models often underestimate the productivity of semi-arid ecosystems.

### Introduction

Plant water use strategies encompass the numerous ways plants have evolved to confront an inescapable dilemma: obtaining the raw materials for photosynthesis necessitates water loss through stomata [@berry2010]. Gradients of water potential ($\Psi$) drive water transport and integrate the tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss, such that the popular iso/anisohydry spectrum is based on the stomatal regulation of $\Psi$ [@tardieu1998; @jones1998].
Isohydry describes a conservative strategy of stomatal closure to maintain $\Psi$ above a threshold to preserve hydraulic conductivity, while anisohydry is a profligate stomatal strategy that prioritizes carbon gain at the expense of low $\Psi$.
While entire species have been placed on the iso/anisohydry spectrum, recent work has shown that variable strategies within species, which accords with hydraulic theory [@hochberg2018].
Within species shifts in iso/anisohydry were reported for *Larrea tridentata* [@guo2020] and *Quercus douglasii* [@feng2019] in different seasons, in *Quercus suber* due to competition [@haberstroh], and in multiple species between wet and dry years [@wu2021].

However, the C implications of temporally-variable hydraulic strategies are not well understood, even as they become more important for forecasting and ameliorating the effects of climate change [@novick2022; @kennedy2019]. In the semi-arid climate where these dynamic hydraulic strategies are found, persistent water limitation and episodic precipitation promote tight coupling between carbon and water cycles [@biederman2016], resulting in added temporal complexity that can be difficult to model [@ogle2004; @noy-meir1973; @loik2004]. Semi-arid ecosystems are largely responsible for the interannual variability of the global carbon sink [@poulter2014; @ahlstr√∂m2015], including rapid vegetation expansion associated with wet years, yet dynamic global vegetation models are prone to underestimating C uptake in dryland regions [@macbean2021].
Understanding the temporal dynamics and environmental sensitivity of plant hydraulic strategies may be critical to improving predictive forecasts of the global carbon cycle.

One iconic emblem of climate change was drought-induced mortality in pinyon-juniper woodlands in the southwestern US.
Pinyon mortality following the 2002-2003 drought was associated with differences in plant hydraulic regulation [@breshears2009; @plaut2012]; juniper survival was largely attributed to less hydraulically vulnerable xylem and thus greater ability to withstand low water potentials [@mcdowell2008].
Although generally considered anisohydric, *Juniperus monosperma* exhibited strong stomatal control and negligible xylem embolism under drought manipulation [@garcia-forner2016], thus challenging the paradigm of anisohydric species being prone to hydraulic failure.
As the southwestern US megadrought persists [@williams2022] and induces mortality even among resilient *Juniperus spp.* [@kannenberg2021], it is imperative to probe how anisohydryic strategies interact with plant productivity and survival.

In this study, we utilize a five month time-series of plant $\Psi$ and ecosystem C fluxes in a juniper woodland to evaluate the relationship and temporal dynamics between hydraulic strategy and gross primary productivity (GPP).
We ask:

1)  Does plant hydraulic regulation vary over time in *J. osteosperma*?
2)  How do the environmental drivers and their timescales of influence compare between plant hydraulic strategy and GPP?
3)  What is the relationship between hydraulic strategy and GPP over a growing season?

We believe this is one of the first studies to contemporaneously measure plant $\Psi$ and GPP at daily temporal resolution, which allows as to probe the implications of $\Psi$ regulation for productivity in an iconic southwestern species.
