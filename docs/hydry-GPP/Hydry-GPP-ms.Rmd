### Summary

-   Some plants exhibit temporally flexible hydraulic regulation, wherein the strictness of hydraulic control (e.g., iso/anisohydry) change in response to environmental conditions, but the implications of flexible hydraulic behavior for plant productivity is unknown.
    The temporal responses of hydraulic behavior and gross primary productivity (GPP) were evaluated for *Juniperus osteosperma*, a semi-arid woodland conifer considered relatively drought resistant.

-   Using a 5-month growing season timeseries of *in situ* plant water potential ($\Psi$) and GPP, the stringency of hydraulic regulation and plant productivity were explored relative to soil water availability and atmospheric demand.

-   *J. osteosperma* experiences weaker hydraulic regulation and higher productivity after monsoon precipitation pulses, when soil moisture water and atmospheric demand are both high.
    The relationship between $\Psi_{PD}$ and $\Psi_{MD}$ ($\sigma$) is strongly correlated with GPP, although only during the monsoon period.
    Interestingly, GPP response more rapidly to moisture inputs than $\sigma$.

-   Flexible hydraulic regulation appears to allow *J. osteosperma* to prolong the period of high carbon uptake following episodic rain events during the growing season.
    While the underlying physiological mechanisms that allow for temporal adjustment need further study, this flexibility can partially explain the success of some drought-tolerant species and suggests why dynamic vegetation models often underestimate the productivity of semi-arid ecosystems.

### Introduction

Plant water use strategies encompass the numerous ways plants have evolved to confront an inescapable dilemma: obtaining the raw materials for photosynthesis necessitates water loss through stomata [@berry2010]. Gradients of water potential ($\Psi$) drive water transport and integrate the tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss, such that the popular iso/anisohydry spectrum is based on the stomatal regulation of $\Psi$ [@tardieu1998; @jones1998].
Isohydry describes a conservative strategy of stomatal closure to maintain $\Psi$ above a threshold to preserve hydraulic conductivity, while anisohydry is a profligate stomatal strategy that prioritizes carbon gain at the expense of low $\Psi$.
While entire species have been placed on the iso/anisohydry spectrum, recent work has shown that variable strategies within species, which accords with hydraulic theory [@hochberg2018].
Within species shifts in iso/anisohydry were reported for *Larrea tridentata* [@guo2020] and *Quercus douglasii* [@feng2019] in different seasons, in *Quercus suber* due to competition [@haberstroh], and in multiple species between wet and dry years [@wu2021].

However, the C implications of temporally-variable hydraulic strategies are not well understood, even as they become more important for forecasting and ameliorating the effects of climate change [@novick2022; @kennedy2019]. In the semi-arid climate where these dynamic hydraulic strategies are found, persistent water limitation and episodic precipitation promote tight coupling between carbon and water cycles [@biederman2016], resulting in added temporal complexity that can be difficult to model [@ogle2004; @noy-meir1973; @loik2004]. Semi-arid ecosystems are largely responsible for the interannual variability of the global carbon sink [@poulter2014; @ahlström2015], including rapid vegetation expansion associated with wet years, yet dynamic global vegetation models are prone to underestimating C uptake in dryland regions [@macbean2021].
Understanding the temporal dynamics and environmental sensitivity of plant hydraulic strategies may be critical to improving predictive forecasts of the global carbon cycle.

One iconic emblem of climate change was drought-induced mortality in piñon-juniper woodlands in the southwestern US.
Piñon mortality following the 2002-2003 drought was associated with differences in plant hydraulic regulation [@breshears2009; @plaut2012]; juniper survival was largely attributed to less hydraulically vulnerable xylem and thus greater ability to withstand low water potentials [@mcdowell2008].
Although generally considered anisohydric, *Juniperus monosperma* exhibited strong stomatal control and negligible xylem embolism under drought manipulation [@garcia-forner2016], thus challenging the paradigm of anisohydric species being prone to hydraulic failure.
As the southwestern US megadrought persists [@williams2022] and induces mortality even among resilient *Juniperus* spp.
[@kannenberg2021], it is imperative to probe how anisohydryic strategies interact with plant productivity and survival.

In this study, we utilize a five month time-series of plant $\Psi$ and ecosystem C fluxes in a juniper woodland to evaluate the relationship and temporal dynamics between hydraulic strategy and gross primary productivity (GPP).
We ask:

1)  Does plant hydraulic regulation vary over time in *J. osteosperma*?
2)  How do the environmental drivers and their timescales of influence compare between plant hydraulic strategy and GPP?
3)  What is the relationship between hydraulic strategy and GPP over a growing season?

We believe this is one of the first studies to contemporaneously measure plant $\Psi$ and GPP at daily temporal resolution, which allows as to probe the implications of $\Psi$ regulation for productivity in an iconic southwestern species.

### Materials and Methods

This study was conducted at an early-successional piñon-juniper woodland (37.5241 N, 109.7471 W, 1866 m a.s.l.) in southeastern Utah.
Local climate conditions include cold winters and hot, dry summers, with high interannual variability in summer precipitation due to its location at the northern boundary of the North American Monsoon.
The locally flat topography is dominated by Utah juniper (*Juniperus osteosperma*, 92% tree basal area) and two-needle piñon (*Pinus edulis*, 8% tree basal area), with sparse understory comprising big sagebrush (*Artemisia tridentata*), prickly pear cactus (*Opuntia* spp.), and bunchgrasses.
See Kannenberg et al. in review for more site details.

#### Eddy covariance and environmental variables

An eddy covariance flux tower (AmeriFlux US-Cdm) was deployed in June 2019 to measure fluxes of water, carbon, and energy and to monitor site-level meteorological and soil variables [@kannenberg2022].
The sonic anemometer (Campbell Scientific CSAT3), open-path infrared gas analyzer (Campbell Scientific EC150), and temperature/relative humidity sensor (Vaisala HMP155) were installed at a height of 8 m, while the net radiometer (Kipp and Zonen CNR4) and photosynthetic photon flux density sensor (Kipp and Zonen PQS1) were installed at a height of 6.45 m.
Site precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge (Campbell Scientific TE535WS), while volumetric water content and temperature of the soil were monitored with five sensors (Acclima TDT) deployed at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm.
See Kannenberg et al. in review for additional details on calibration and maintenance.

Eddy covariance and environmental data were processed first by summarizing to half-hourly values, gapfilling, and then sumamrizing to daily values used the the subsequent figures and analysis.
High frequency eddy covariance data were processed into half-hourly values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using *EasyFlux PC* (Campbell Scientific) following a procedure of despiking [@vickers1997], coordinate rotation, spectral correction [@massman2000], and Webb-Pearman-Leuning density correction [@webb1980]. NEE was gap-filled using the 50th percentile Ustar distribution and partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration using the nighttime method [@reichstein2005] in the R package 'REddyProc' [@wutzler2018].
All environmental variables were summarized to half-hourly means or sums where appropriate; air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (D), and incoming shortwave radiation were gap-filled using the MDS algorithm [@reichstein2005].
Ecosystem fluxes and precipitation were aggregated to daily sums, D was summarized to daily maximums, and the remaining environmental variables were summarized as daily means.

#### Plant water potential

Stem water potential of seven mature *J. osteosperma* within the tower footprint (\< 20 m) were monitored with both automated and manual measurements between May 24 and November 5, 2021.
Half-hourly water potential was monitored with stem psychrometers (ICT International PSY1) that were calibrated prior to installtion.
Two instruments were installed per tree by removing the bark and phloem to expose a flat xylem surface.
Psychrometer sensor heads were attached with self-adhesive silicone tape to maintain a tight seal and wrapped in reflective insulation to minimize temperature gradients.
Because plant wounding responses can fill the sensor chamber, all psychrometers were uninstalled, cleaned with chloroform, and reinstalled on a new branch every 4-5 weeks.
The day after reinstallation, xylem water potential was measured manually with a Scholander-type pressure chamber (PMS 610) by excising a needle cluster with diameter between 2 and 4 mm and measuring within X minutes of collection.

Half-hourly stem water potential time series were subject to quality control by visual assessment and processed to daily values.
After removing data during the maintenance period (+ 1 day) and outliers that were \> 0.5 MPa way from adjacent points, data that met the following criteria were also discarded: 1) a step change in the magnitude of water potential not attributable to a precipitation event; 2) loss of diurnal pattern in water potential.
On average, data from 10 of 14 psychrometers were available during a given period.
Half-hourly stem water potential was summarized to predawn ($\Psi_{PD}$, 2 hours prior to sunrise) and midday ($\Psi_{PD}$, 2 hours following solar noon) for each logger.
