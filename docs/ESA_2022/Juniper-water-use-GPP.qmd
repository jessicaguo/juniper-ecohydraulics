## Water Use Strategies

::: incremental
-   Plant water use strategies link terrestrial carbon and water cycles

-   Iso/anisohydry is one metric of water status regulation

    -   drop in $\Psi_{MD}$ relative to $\Psi_{PD}$ [@mart√≠nez-vilalta2014]

## Juniper woodlands

-   Although considered anisohydric, *Juniperus* spp. exhibit tight stomatal control in response to drought [@garcia-forner2016]

-   *Juniperus* spp. in southeastern UT at risk of drought-induced mortality [@kannenberg2021a]

## Temporally varying water use strategies

![](images/paste-4E7615B2.png)

-   *Larrea tridentata* [@guo2020]

-   *Quercus douglasii* [@feng2019]

-   *Quercus suber* & *Cistus ladanifer* [@haberstroh2022]

## Importance for global C fluxes

::: incremental
-   Interannual variation in the terrestrial carbon sink largely attributed to drylands [@poulter2014a]

    -   Includes rapid vegetation expansion in wet years

-   Global vegetation models are prone to underestimating C uptake in drylands [@macbean2021]

    -   During the monsoon at low elevations

-   Could rapid shifts in plant hydraulic regulation be responsible?

## Research questions

1)  Does the relationship between $\Psi_{PD}$ and $\Psi_{MD}$ vary over time in *Juniperus osteosperma*?

2)  How do the environmental drivers and their timescales of influence compare between plant hydraulic strategy ($\sigma$) and GPP?

3)  What is the relationship between hydraulic strategy and GPP over a growing season?
