# Introduction

Plant species exhibit a range of water use strategies to manage the tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss. One metric of hydraulic regulation [@martinez2014] utilizes the slope ($\sigma$) between predawn and midday water potential ($\Psi$), wherein isohydry ($\sigma < 1$) suggests a conservative approach to maintain water transport capacity and anisohydry ($\sigma \geq 1$) suggests a profligate strategy to maximize carbon gain. However, recent evidence shows that some species can alter water use strategies seasonally [@guo2020], the detection of which has previously been limited by the frequency of $\Psi$ measurements. Here, we monitor and evaluate the hydraulic strategy of *Juniperus osteosperma*, a drought-tolerant conifer classically described as anisohydric.

## **Questions**
1. Does the relationship between predawn and midday $\Psi$ vary over time in *J. osteosperma*?  
2. Is the degree of iso/anisohydry driven by soil and atmospheric drivers?
3. Is the degree of iso/anisohydry associated with site-level GPP?

# Methods

  - Seven mature *J. osteosperma* instrumented with 2 automated stem psychrometers each during the 2021 growing season (Fig. \@ref(fig:pic))
  - Co-located with Ameriflux site (US-CdM) in southeastern UT, where *J. osteosperma* comprises ~92% of tree basal area
  - Psychrometers cleaned and rotated ~monthly
  - $\Psi$ measured ~monthly with a manual pressure chamber

```

  - Daily predawn and midday $\Psi$ related to maximum daily VPD and VWC at 10 cm in a stochastic antecedent model: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Psi_{MD_i} &= \lambda_i + \sigma_i \cdot \Psi_{PD_i}\\
\lambda_i, \sigma_i &= \beta_1 + \beta_1 \cdot D_{i}^{ant} + \beta_2 \cdot W_{10_i}^{ant} + \beta_4 \cdot D_{i}^{ant} \cdot W_{10_i}^{ant}\\
X_i^{ant} &= \sum_{p = 0}^{T_{lag}-1}\omega_p \cdot X_{t(i)-p}
\end{aligned}
$$

```
  - Due to strong monsoon in 2021 (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-env)), $\Psi_{PD}$ remained above -2 MPa for most of August and the first half of September (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-psy))
    
  - Model fit was high ($R^2 = 0.92$), with low bias
   
  - Wet soil, dry air, and their combination were positively correlated with higher $\sigma$, or greater anisohydry (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-cov))
  
  - Combination of wet soil and dry air caused the pressure drop at $\Psi_{soil} = 0$ ($\lambda$) to decrease (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-cov))
   
  - *J. osteosperma* exhibited temporally variable hydraulic strategies, becoming extremely anisohydric ($\sigma > 1$) after monsoon onset (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-hydry))
   
  - Iso/anisohydry, as indexed by $\sigma$, was positively correlated with site-level GPP ($p < 0.001$, $r = 0.6$, Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-gpp))

```

# Discussion

  - Although *J. osteosperma* is considered to have an anisohydric response to drought, extreme anisohydry was associated with monsoon onset
  
  - Aligns with previous findings of conservative drought responses of *J. monosperma* under experimental conditions [@garcia2016]
  
  - Classically anisohydric species (e.g., *Larrea tridentata*, *Juniperus spp.*) may be more flexible and responsive in their hydraulic strategies, not necessarily associated with high embolism
  
  - Iso/anisohydry is well-correlated with GPP, confirming that extreme anisohydry is a strategy for maximizing carbon uptake
  
  - Next steps include some kind of model comparison for evaluating the added value of iso/anisohydry for predicting GPP
